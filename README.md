# Lagrange-Multipliers-Extremum-Estimation
Simulation for maximization and minimization of Langrange Functions and finding the extremum points of bounded functions using weight decay method used in Gradient Descent/ Ascent Algorithm.
1. Maximization of f(x) = (x+3)<sup>2</sup> bound to (x+2) <= 0.
2. Minimization of f(x) = -(x+3)<sup>2</sup> bound to (x+2) <= 0.
